<h2>Preparing Rice</h2>
<p>Get about 3-4 cups of rice and then pour them into the container (other sources usually say 1 1/2 cups, but it varies per person).  Once you have done so, start moving on to the rinsing process.</p>

<h2>Rinsing Process</h2>
<p>Start pouring cold tap water from the sink into the container. To measure how much water you need, place your pointer finger gently on to of the rice, then once the water reaches 1/3 of your pointer finger, stop and continue with the  next process.
  Next, start using your hands to scoop the rice and then grind the rice by putting your two hands together and moving in opposite directions. 
  This will make sure that germs and other debris will get rinsed out.
  Once the water in the container turns milky white, repeat the rinsing 3 times then fill the water to about 1/3 of your pointer finger.
Water must be filled to about 1/3rd so that the rice doesn't end up mushy when the cooking process is finished.</p>
