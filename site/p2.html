<h1>The 3 Main Types Of Chocolates</h1>

<h1>White Chocolate</h1>
<p>White Chocolate is a type of chocolate made of about 30-45% cacao butter, 25-40% milk powder, and 25-55% sugar, 
  which is double the amount of contents that milk chocolate is made of. It has a very sweet taste and smooth texture but is also very creamy due to the high fat and sugar, 
  sometimes making it repetitive to take a bite again.  </p>
