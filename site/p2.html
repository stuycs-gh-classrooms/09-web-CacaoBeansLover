<h1 class="W">White Chocolate</h1>
<p class="White"> White Chocolate is a type of chocolate made of about 30-45% cocoa butter, 25-40% milk powder, and 25-55% sugar, 
   which is double the amount of contents that milk chocolate is made of. It has a very sweet taste and smooth texture but is also very creamy due to the high fat and sugar, 
   sometimes making it repetitive to take a bite again. White chocolate is mostly paired with caramel or raspberry syrup to make the chocolate even more sweeter. </p>
