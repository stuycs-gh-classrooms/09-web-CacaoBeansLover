<h1>The 3 Main Types Of Chocolates</h1>

<h1>Dark Chocolate</h1>
<p>Dark chocolate is a chocolate of about 65-99% cocoa mass and 1-40% sugar. What sets this chocolate apart from the others is that it does not contain any milk powder.
   Because of its potential low sugar content, dark chocolate is also said to have health benefits such as: 
  <ul>  <li>Lower risk of Diabetes</li>
        <li>Important minerals including zinc, iron, and magnesium</li>
        <li>High fiber</li>
        <li>Improved blood flow</li>
  </ul> 
 Dark Chocolate can vary on taste depending on sugar, sometimes tasting bitter or sweet.</p>
