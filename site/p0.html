<h1 class="M">How to Make Homemade Milk Chocolate(Ordinary Chocolate) </h1> /* https://www.instructables.com/Homemade-Milk-Chocolate-4-Ingredients/ */
<h2 class="M">Ingredients and Items</h2>
 <ul class="Milk"> 
 <li>Pot and bowl(s)</li>
 <li>Large spoon or spatula</li>
 <li>An ice cube tray or chocolate bar mold</li>
 <li> 1/2 cup of cocoa butter or coconut oil </li>
 <li> 3 tablespoons of whole milk powder</li>
 <li> 1/3 cup of cocoa powder</li>
 <li>3/4 cup of powdered sugar</li>
 </ul>

<h2 class="M">Step 1</h2>
<p class="Milk">Place a pot filled with 1/3 of water on a stove with medium-high heat then grab a large bowl to cover the pot. Add the cocoa butter/coconut oil inside the bowl and 
 keep stirring until everything melts. </p>

 <h2 class="M">Step 2</h2>
 <p class="Milk">Turn the heat to medium-low and then stir the cocoa powder before mixing the powder with the bowl of cocoa butter using a spatula. Once you have mixed both turn off the heat and then mix and add the milk powder until no trace of it remains.
 Slowly add the powdered sugar and stir until you see no trace of it (Adding the powdered sugar is optional  if you don't want the chocolate to become too sweet, or just add a little bit of sugar). After you've stirred the sugar, keep stirring for another 5 minutes before moving on to the next step. </p>

 <h2 class="M">Step 3</h2>
 <p class="Milk">Grab the bowl off the pot and then leave it on a counter or flat surface to stir for another 5 minutes (This will make the texture smooth). Pour the chocolate into the ice cube tray/bar mold and then wait for 30 minutes before placing it into the fridge for another 30 minites</p>

 <h2 class="M">Step 4</h2>
 <p class="Milk">Take the tray/mold out of the fridge and enjoy.</p>
